hello ,
This is a simple yet interactive Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game 
built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It’s a great beginner-friendly project to understand DOM manipulation, game logic, and basic UI/UX design without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

The main technologies used are - 
HTML – Structure and layout

CSS – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity
